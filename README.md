# Cleaning-Data-in-Python [Nots](https://github.com/cc59chong/Cleaning-Data-in-Python/blob/main/Cleaning%20Data%20in%20Python.ipynb)
You will learn how to identify, diagnose, and treat a variety of data cleaning problems in Python, ranging from simple to advanced. You will deal with improper data types, check that your data is in the correct range, handle missing data, perform record linkage, and more!
## 1 -- Common data problems
Convert data types, apply range constraints to remove future data points, and remove duplicated data points to avoid double-counting.
Keywords: `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, `strip()`, `pd.to_datetime`, 'dt.date`, `.duplicated()`, `.sort_values()`, `.drop_duplicates()`, `.agg()`, `.reset_index()`
